    <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
    <p>Web development is a career which  i like very much and want to create my skills in it.<br>
       As during the lockdown it was one of the jobs which  were primarily allowed to work from home.<br>
      Moreover, it is a job for creative thinkers who tend love the challenges faced during the work.  </p>
    <p> I choose this career becuase from my childhood i had an massive interest in websites and the working of it. </p>
